      Hi! &#57627;
      I'm an up and coming full stack web developer currently enrolled in Lambda School. (INSERT LAMBDA LOGO)<br>
      I've been working in the technology sector for over a decade, finally making the leap from the business to the technical side.<br>
      Having worked in various industries, at headquarters as well as remotely, on teams ranging from two to fifty, my breadth of experience in various type of work environments makes me quite flexible.<br>
      From early on in my career, I was fortunate to have the concept of a team-first mentality imprinted into me, I will always prefer working in such environments.<br>
      My interests range from health & nutrition, to the environment, to bio-hacking and bloackhain-enabled technologies.<br>
      I look forward to connecting with you and exploring if there is an opportunity for us to work together.<br>
      Thank you for taking the time to review my work.
    </p>

 Mixins: Create 2 mixins of your choosing. Hint: It's super helpful to use flexbox properties in mixins
 Mobile: Use nested-at rules to provide a mobile version of your resume. Use 500px as a max-width for mobile. -->
